# 🎂 Birthday Greeting Card – Embedded Systems Project

This is a microcontroller-based greeting card that plays a birthday tune and blinks LEDs when powered. It features a custom-designed PCB and firmware written in Arduino C++.

## 📦 Features
- Plays sound using a piezo buzzer
- Controls multiple LEDs in sync with music
- Runs on ATtiny85 or similar microcontroller
- Compact PCB layout (Gerber files included)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Gerber viewer
- PCB Design Software (e.g., EasyEDA, KiCad)
